# Guix Build Analysis

## Issue Found

The guix-build.yml workflow is failing with the error:
```
invalid field specifier
```

### Root Cause

The error log shows that the Guix package definition includes packages that are **not imported** in the current guix.scm file:
- `cxxtest` (in native-inputs)
- `blas` (in inputs)
- `lapack` (in inputs)
- `gsl` (in inputs)

These packages appear in the CI log but are NOT present in the current guix.scm file in the repository.

### Current State

The current guix.scm (lines 136-147) has:
```scheme
(native-inputs
 (list pkg-config
       cmake
       rust))
(inputs
 (list python
       python-numpy
       python-pandas
       python-scikit-learn
       python-matplotlib
       guile-3.0
       boost))
```

But the CI is trying to build with:
```scheme
(native-inputs (list pkg-config cmake rust cxxtest))
(inputs (list python python-numpy python-pandas python-scikit-learn python-matplotlib guile-3.0 boost blas lapack gsl))
```

### Root Cause Confirmed

The issue is that `.guix/modules/opencog-package.scm` contains the packages `cxxtest`, `blas`, `lapack`, and `gsl`, but:

1. The main `guix.scm` file does NOT import these packages in its module imports
2. The main `guix.scm` file does NOT include these packages in its inputs/native-inputs
3. There's a syntax error in `.guix/modules/opencog-package.scm` line 91: `` `(,rust "cargo") `` which is invalid Guix syntax

The CI is likely using a different version or there's confusion between the two package definitions.

## Additional Issues Found

1. **YAML linting warnings**:
   - Missing document start marker `---`
   - Lines exceeding 80 characters
   - Truthy value format

2. **Workflow robustness**:
   - The workflow doesn't have proper error handling
   - No caching of Guix installation
   - Commented out `guix pull` which could cause version mismatches

## Recommended Fixes

1. Add missing package imports to guix.scm
2. Fix YAML formatting issues
3. Improve workflow with caching and better error handling
4. Add validation step before build
